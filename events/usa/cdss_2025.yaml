From a handful of fiddle members, we have grown into a band with typically eight members who play fiddle, banjo, guitar, piano, mandolin, whistle, bass and percussion.\nCaller: Don Heinold. Hailing from Rhode Island, Don has been calling at dances, weddings & parties all over New England for over 14 years. Don is also known for teaching the rotary (country) waltz.\nAdmission: Suggested donation: $5 per person / $20 per couple or family / children under 3 free.

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \n​Recorded Music: $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \n\n\n\n\n​“Pay What You Want” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th) – Newcomers especially encouraged to attend!"

We invite you to come and share their musical journey with us through music and dance.\nScholarship Program: This year we are also restarting the scholarship program for new and developing callers. It is an opportunity to learn about the traditional dance and participate in our Callers’ Showcase. To apply, send an email to info@ralphpage.neffa.org.\nThe Ralph Page Dance Event Committee: Chair: Tod Whittemore. Members: Paul Lizotte (Program), Don Heinold (Publicity), Matt Burke, Justin Godin, Richard Hart, Sandy Lafleur, Gary Nielsen, Andy Taylor-Blenis\nNotes: The Ralph Page Dance Legacy Weekend began in 1988 to recognize the contributions that Ralph Page made to contra and New England folk dancing. Ralph Page (1903-1985) was known as “the dean of contra dance callers.” He almost single-handedly kept contra dancing alive in the United States when many had abandoned their local dances for that new invention, the television. Page was a dance organizer, band leader, caller, author, and recording artist as well as a leader of weekly dances and dance camps.\n\nPage was one of the founders of the New England Folk Festival Association and served as its president from 1960-1963. The New Hampshire Library of Traditional Music and Dance is the site to which Ralph Page donated his archives.\nThe Ralph Page Dance Legacy Weekend presents traditional New England contra and square dancing as Page did it, along with modern dance styles as well.\n\n\nClothing & Footwear: Just bring, clean shoes to dance in to preserve the floor (no high heels please). Dress is comfortable and as you like.\nRole Terms are: “Ladies & Gents” but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role that works for them as has been done over the years."

    details: "In a contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing, except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton, and modern compositions."

    details: "2nd Sunday of the Month: \nLive Music with Anytime English Players \nEnglish country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \nLive Music: $15 General | $12 Member | $8 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21)"

  - name: Contra Dance at Tapestry Folkdance Center
    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

  - name: Sebastopol 1st and 3rd Sunday English Dance
    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "When: Dance 7:30-10:30pm [beginners session 7:15 pm]\nWhat: Want to meet new people, get some exercise and try something different? Consider contra dancing! It’s good, clean fun. “We get people of all ages. It’s unique, it’s different and it’s a lot of fun.” Contra dancing is a couples dance that begins in two lines. That’s why it’s called contra dancing, because you’re standing opposite — or contra — your partner. “You start in lines and then you dance in and out of formations,” following moves announced by a caller. Our dance is accompanied by live music! So come out and enjoy friendly camaraderie, dance to live fiddle music and see everyone’s smiling faces! No need to bring a partner, nor have past experience or know how!\nLive Music: by Jumpstart! JumpStart was formed around 21 years ago after an M.I.T. contra dance when Gene (bass), Paul (fiddle), and Victor (piano) decided to continue what had been a chance grouping. Paul took over the Manchester NH Dance in 2008 and JumpStart became the house band! They are an exciting and percussive band!\nCaller: Don Heinold. Hailing from Rhode Island, Don has been calling at dances, weddings, and parties all over New England for over 14 years. Don is also known for his clear calling and teaching the popular rotary (or “turning”) waltz.\nAdmission: $10, $7 students, $20 families"

Don is also known for teaching the Rotary (country) Waltz.\nAdmission: Admission is $10 regular admission & $5 for students and those 12 years or younger.\nRole Terms: We are a traditional contra dance, “Ladies & Gents” or “Women & Men” are the terms we use, but, dancers are welcome to choose whatever role that works for them with no worries.\nParking: plenty of parking around the Kingston, NH, Town Hall.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual. Shoes that move easily on the floor work fine but rubber soled sneakers are ok but make dancing much harder."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

This will be a weekend filled with soaking, dancing, lovely music, great food, and fun with old and new friends.  \nThis dance has been on hold for five years, we are very excited to bring this dance weekend back and see all of your lovely faces!  \nCarrie Dayton-Madsen, Ray Madsen, and Courtney Brueckner"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "David Smukler with Hot Toddy \nDavid Smukler has been dancing since the 1960s, calling contras since the 1980s and calling English country dances since the 1990s. He is a gentle and engaging teacher who particularly enjoys a wide variety of dances including some of his own creations. David currently is President of the Country Dance and Song Society. He is also the co-author of Cracking Chestnuts. \nHot Toddy is Anna Rain (recorders), Edith Coakley (fiddle, viola) and Melissa Running (piano). They are passionate about making music for English country dancing. They love the canon of dance tunes stretching from the 14th century to 2025, and the improvisatory journeys on which they tend to find themselves. Based in Philadelphia, they’ve played up and down the coast from Virginia to the New England Folk Festival. \nFor hospitality, email arthur.mcnair@verizon.net. For Covid safety info, check CDSSP.org for updates. For registration information and financial aid requests, email ifinke@yahoo.com. \nThis event takes place in Homestead, PA, about 30 minutes from Pittsburgh."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "The June 28th dance will offer two special features – a time of community fellowship around a potluck meal and a dance workshop to build your skills as a dancer with Columbia callers Dianne Palmer-Quay and Victor Gascon. \nThe evening will start with a potluck meal at 6:00 pm. Bring your own plates and eating utensils and a dish to share.  Water and cups will be provided. The dance workshop will start once everyone has finished eating. \nThe remainder of the evening will focus on making you a more confident contra dancer through direct teaching and dancing practice. Both basic skills and more advanced figures will be covered. You will become more comfortable with foundational skills such as the swing, courtesy turn, and petronella, as well as practice less familiar figures such as mad robin, contra corners and box circulate. Twirls and flourishes and the contra waltz will also be discussed. Short dances to recorded music will allow you to practice the highlighted skill as it is taught. Larks and robins will be used as the role terms for the dancers.   \nBoth new and experienced dancers are encouraged to attend. Every effort will be made to send you home from the evening feeling more confident in your ability to navigate the dance floor."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Together, we participate in the rich traditional music, dance, and song program offered by our skilled staff. \nMorning classes are enjoyed by age groupings, with younger participants delighting in traditional song, dance, stories, and crafts, facilitated by expert children’s educators. Meanwhile, teens and adults choose from an array of energizing community dance classes. Teens are welcome to join in adult activities throughout the day but also have a daily class of their own that will weave together music and dance with dynamic instructors. \nEach day there are two all-community gatherings (morning and evening) where staff and campers alike share stories, songs, and talents. There is also time in the afternoon for campers to offer one-off classes, so bring your talents to share! \nNestled between two pristine New England ponds offering daily idyllic swimming and canoeing, both natural beauty and community spirit are ever-present. Together, we celebrate the charm of living in woodland cabins, eating delicious home-cooked meals, and participating in the rich traditional music, dance, and song program offered by our skilled staff."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat. \nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

This year, the week is loosely focused on percussive dance and the musical conversations between and among dancers, vocalists, and instrument-players. If you love to sing, dance, jam, or do all of those at the same time, this is the week for you! Though there will also be plenty of opportunities to do them just one at a time as well. \nEach day’s schedule includes an all-camp singing session, an all-camp dance session (where both newcomer and experienced dancers will find a lesson for their skill level), and many types of singing, dancing, and instrumental workshops, including some that invite collaboration between and among dancers, musicians, and singers. \nEvery evening, we will enjoy mini-concerts by our brilliant staff, followed by a dance featuring contra and English country dancing, plus some late-night festivities. Within each jam-packed day, there is also time built into the schedule for jamming, snoozing, swimming, chatting, or taking some solo time if you need it. Pinewoods offers a beautiful venue for a glorious week of song, dance, learning, connection, revelry, and rejuvenation. I look forward to singing and dancing with you there!"

The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Last Monday of the Month 8-10:30pm \nIn a contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall.

Afternoons are all-comers sessions, where we build community and intergenerational connection. And all-camp gatherings are a chance for campers and staff to perform music, tell jokes and stories, and highlight what they’ve learned and built during camp.  \nIn addition to music, ECD, morris, singing, contra, bal folk, longsword, waltz, stories, mummers’ play, and crafts, you’ll also have a chance to swim, hike, nap, jam, socialize, and after-party. We dance together as a community, then sing sequential waves of children off to bed, giving adults a chance to dance while monitors keep track of the dreamers.  \nCome recharge, reconnect, relax, and renew as we gather together to share joy and reinvigorate traditions and invent new ones.

    details: "Cascade of Music & Dance at Camp Kweebec, just northwest of Philadelphia, is a full week of music, art, and community celebrating the living traditions of song and dance. \nThis week brings the whole singing Amidon family together on staff: singing leaders and music educators Peter and Mary Alice, who met at a CDSS camp in the 1970s; master musician Sam Amidon, who has taken his community-oriented folk music roots out into the world of performance art; and Stefan Amidon, who has followed in his parents’ footsteps as music educator for the young and singing leader for all. \nAdd to this seasoned players who have inspired generations of musicians (Danny Noveck and Karen Axelrod), musicians and teachers who grew up in musical families (Sophie Wellington, Anna Patton, Elvie Miller, Elizabeth LaPrelle, Sally Jablonsky), some great callers with a wealth of knowledge about the craft (Joanna Reiner Wilkinson and Mary Wesley) plus ethnomusicologist/instrumentalist/singing leader/songwriter Brian Dolphin and lyrical fiddler and tunesmith Ben Schreiber and you’ve got the makings for a very special week! \nChildren attend classes with their age group in the morning, where they sing, craft, dance, and play, while the older campers attend their choice of dances, harmony singing workshops, step-dance instruction, and a class for budding callers. Twice a day, the whole camp comes together for a community dance and a gathering for games, stories, participatory songs, and staff and camper performances. After the kids are paraded to bed by the pied piper, watched over by roving monitors, more dancing and late night activities commence. \nIf you are looking to dance the week away to phenomenal music, or to build your repertoire or deepen your knowledge of traditional music, or wish you had more time to make art and sing, or if you are simply looking to make some connections with a fantastic group of people in this fractured world, then make your way to Cascade!"

  - name: Campers’ Week at Pinewoods
    details: "It’s right there in the name! Campers’ Week is a week like no other—not just for campers, but by campers, who join a small-but-mighty staff in offering classes, leading dances, playing in the band, performing at gatherings, teaching crafts, decorating for the ball, hosting parties, and sharing whatever talent they’d like. If you love helping to make the magic happen, and you’re between the ages of 0 and 187, this is the session for you! Bring your parents, your best friend, your neighbor, your siblings, your kids, your cousins, your spouse, your fiancé, your grandkids, or just yourself (if you’re over 18) for a week of multi-generational, camper-enhanced family fun. \nWhat do we love? At morning and evening gatherings, people of all ages share a tune, tell a story, showcase a skill, sing, laugh, and dance together. During the day, kids under 13 gather twice with their peers—who may well become lifelong friends—to learn new dances, sing, craft, or what have you. Teens have their own class session (don’t worry, it’s not first thing in the morning) and all campers age 13+ can join in daily staff-led contra and English dance classes. There’s also ritual dance instruction, a community band, callers’ workshop, plus whatever delights campers offer. When it’s time to give those dancing feet a rest, you can swim, sun, or canoe in a pond, or find a chair on one of the many porches to craft, sing, jam, or just relax and chat with friends new and old.  \nFestivities continue after dinner with a musical procession through the woods to the all-ages dance, which kicks off evening gathering. After the youngest campers head to bed, talented staff lead a vibrant mix of English, contras, squares, and a few surprises, with the help of the camper band—a delightful mélange of professional musicians, talented dabblers, and enthusiastic neophytes—and guest callers. (Want to call a dance? Let us know.) \nAfterwards, the party moves to the Camp House, where a pub sing, auction, skit night, jams, or impromptu low-key gatherings continue into the night… including whatever merriment intrepid campers incite. (Will Kerry sets return this year? Late night English favorites? Nonstop Rory O’More?  If you want it, make it happen!) \nWhether you grew up here and never left, or are joining for the very first time, Campers’ Week welcomes all ages, all skill levels, all talents, all everything. So pack your instrument (even your ukulele!), your voice, your dance shoes, your ball costume, your crafting supplies, your joy, and your sense of adventure. We hope to see you there."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

We expect dancers attending these sessions to be completely comfortable with heys for 3 and 4, dolphin heys, double figure 8s, and triple minor progression. They should also be able to maintain their sense of orientation within the set. This is not the time to bring your friends who are new to English country dancing, though we’d love to see them at the 1st and 3rd Sundays. \nNote: We occasionally change our venue or time to accommodate special events, so please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "We’ve got the High Strung string band coming up from Philly for an extra long set, Abigail Hobart all the way from Spain to call an evening of amazing dances, and a special late night DJ set from Chloe Rosenthal followed by a little more blues dancing at our after party! \nDance Schedule: \n\n7:00pm Lesson\n7:30pm Dancing Starts\n9:20pm Second Half Dancing w/Advanced Dances\n11:00pm Techno Set\n12:00pm Afters at Logan’s Run\n\nHigh Strung is a vibrant new four-piece from Philadelphia. With foot-stomping reels, pulsing marches, and soaring jigs, High Strung blends Celtic, Canadian, and American folk traditions into an electrifying sound, guaranteed to keep the floor moving until the last waltz. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbigail hails from the Pacific Northwest, where she grew up contra dancing, fiddling, and scraping her shins on tree trunks in the verdant woods of coastal Washington State. \nAfter studying ethnomusicology and sustainable food systems in New England for a while, she returned to the Pacific Northwest and worked in the woods for a few years before settling in the Washington, D.C. area. There, she helped produce folk festivals for the National Council of the Traditional Arts, and studied bluegrass fiddle with master fiddler, Rickie Simpkins through a Maryland State Arts Council grant. \nNow, Abigail is based in sunny Granada, Spain, where she is a regular at the local Irish music session, calls square and contra dances anywhere in Europe, sings in a gospel choir, and plays way too much country music for her own good."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "The Baltimore Folk Music Society (BFMS) invites you to a delightful evening of elegant dancing and exuberant music – it’s the BFMS Autumn Assembly English Ball, to be held on Saturday, September 27 from 6:30 to 10 pm. \nThe Autumn Assembly is at Church of the Redeemer, Baltimore. The  Parish Hall has a beautiful wood floor and excellent lighting. There are plenty of parking spaces, and the church is easy to find and well marked. \nBFMS is delighted to feature the wonderful music of Trio Con Brio – Jonathan Jensen on piano (and pennywhistle and ocarina), Elke Baker on violin, and Paul Oorts on mandolin, banjo(!), accordion and more. Callers will include many of the BFMS Monday night regulars. \nThe program of seventeen dances can be found on the BFMS website. The website lists the dances in the order they will be danced, and included on the website are descriptions of all dances and links to helpful videos. \nOrdinarily there would be a practice session on the day of the Autumn Assembly at the same location. This year, due to some scheduling issues, the practice session will be one week earlier, Saturday, September 20, at a different (but nearby) church: Church of the Nativity & Holy Comforter, from 2 to 4:30 pm. Musicians will be Janina O’Brien on piano and Emily Aubrey on violin, and April Blum will call. The emphasis will be on the more complex or unfamiliar dances, and we will try to get through as many as possible.  \nThe Ball will begin at 6:30 pm with a welcome reception, a chance to chat with friends, and an opportunity to take selfies and groupies at this year’s new addition—a beautiful photo backdrop featuring lovely fall foliage. And we will finish with Sapphire Sea and a final waltz no later than 10 pm.  \nPlease join us for this 50th anniversary year celebration. Online registration is open on our website. The price is $35 per person for BFMS or CDSS members, $40 for non-members, and only $20 for students."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

We’re lucky to get to snatch them up after Adirondack Dance Weekend to infuse our own Brattleboro Bal Folk community with some new dances and excellent teaching perspectives! \nBal folk is a vibrant and inclusive dance tradition that started out in France, incorporated a bunch of other European influences, and took Europe and the UK by storm during the past 50 years or so. It has become increasingly popular in North America, no doubt due to its accessibility and captivating energy. You can easily join in even if you’ve never danced before. At Brattleboro Bal Folk, all dances are taught, and part of the big bal folk tradition all over the world is looking around to see what other people are doing and jumping in to try it out. No experience or partner required! Dances are in lines, spirals, circles, and pairs and range from hypnotic to meditative to raucous. The music is infectious! \nPlease bring a clean pair of shoes to change into, or clean your shoes off thoroughly once you get inside, before you step onto the dance floor. We want to protect that beautiful wood floor! \nShare our video with friends to whet their appetite!  \nMasks are welcome but not required.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall.

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Last Monday of the Month 8-10:30pm \nIn a contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today.

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Last Monday of the Month 8-10:30pm \nIn a contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

You can easily join in even if you’ve never danced before. \nAt Brattleboro Bal Folk, all dances are taught (this time, in the beginners workshop and with brief reminders as needed during the bal), and part of the big bal folk tradition all over the world is looking around to see what other people are doing and jumping in to try it out. No experience or partner required! Dances are in lines, spirals, circles, and pairs and range from hypnotic to meditative to raucous. The music is infectious! \nPlease bring a clean pair of shoes to change into, or clean your shoes off thoroughly once you get inside, before you step onto the dance floor.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall.

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."
