    organisation: Scottish Country Dancers of Colorado
  - name: Scandinavian Beginning Class & Weekly Dance
    details: "Come join our Scandinavian Basics dance class series.  This is the time to get started learning Scandinavian couple dance (primarily Swedish).  “Learn to Pivot and Perfect Your Hambo”.  No partner is needed, but low-friction, hard-soled shoes are necessary so that you will be able to pivot (spin) on the beautiful Avalon floors.  Pivoting easily and frequently is a common feature of fast-turning Polska and Pols dancing.  These classes build skills from week to week so attending  regularly is necessary. \nWe almost always dance to live music featuring fiddle, nyckelharpa, accordion, and hardanger fiddle. \nCome dance with us every Monday night (except when Monday falls on or very near a major holiday).  We teach the first hour, followed by open dancing."
