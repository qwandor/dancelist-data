    details: "Fun, accessible French and European traditional dances just outside Brattleboro.\r\nNo experience or partner necessary.\r\n\r\nLive music & dance instruction by Eloise & Co.\r\nBecky Tracy (fiddle) & Rachel Bell (accordion)\r\n\r\nPlease bring a clean pair of shoes to change into, or clean your shoes off thoroughly once you get inside, before you step onto the dance floor. We want to protect that beautiful wood floor!\r\n\r\nSuggested donation sliding scale $12-$25\r\n\r\nDances range from beautiful to raucous. Even if you’ve never tried anything like this before, come on over! Feel free to listen and watch from the sidelines or jump in. We’ll teach you everything you need to know, and the crowd has a reputation for being welcoming, eager to draw newcomers into the fun. We will continue to offer variations and new dances to keep the experienced dancers engaged!\r\n\r\nShare our video with friends to whet their appetite!\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Y8OUy5JM6Jw?si=s8-aKotdPEayFcW0\r\nMasks are welcome but not required. Please stay home if you feel ill or are testing positive for Covid-19.\r\n\r\nTentative next date: April 21. Stay tuned for details.\r\n\r\nMark your calendars for May 31 at the Greenfield Guiding Star Grange. This will be a bal folk PARTY with no teaching. We'll have an intro session first to get the beginners ready and then it will be dance party time! All are welcome at the party, and even if you don't know all the dances, you'll be able to look around and follow what others around you are doing. It's going to be a blast! Check the Eloise & Co. facebook page for updates on exact timing and details."
