  - name: Hayward Contra Dance
    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."
