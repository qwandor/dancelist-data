    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "Yes, we have a new name! The Mystic Pie Dance!\nTime: Dance 7:30-10:30 pm [short basics session @ 7:15 pm]\nThis is so wicked fun! It is the most fun you can have with your clothes on! We dance to live music—the fiddle tunes of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Appalachia, and America. We often switch partners after every dance, so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time!\nLive Music by The Dead Sea Squirrels. Don’t be fooled by the unlikely name—you’re gonna love dancing to Cathy Mason on fiddle; Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, and mandolin (but not all at the same time!); and Henry Yoshimura on guitar. They play widely for contra dances and are known for their danceable tunes arranged in medleys designed to closely match and enhance the movements of the particular contra dance being taught/called. They tend to push the boundaries of the southern style with fiddle and fiddle/guitar harmonies!\nCaller: Paul Wilde from RI. Paul was a schoolteacher for 16 years and said that his classroom experience helped him to develop his calling skills on the dance floor.\nAdmission: $10 adults, $7 students. Donations gratefully accepted!\nHomemade Pie Slices! This month we offer pumpkin pie and other kinds of fall pies! These delicious pie slices are offered at the break for $3/slice to help support the band and caller.\nRole Terms are: “Ladies & Gents” (or Women & Men) but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role their heart desires.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual, layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneaker are discouraged but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder).\nParking: Plenty of parking in the large parking area next to the building!"

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

We often switch partners after every dance so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time! So come enjoy the friendly camaraderie, dance to live music and see everyone’s smiling faces!\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual; layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged).\nFood: Some snacks offered at the break and contributions are welcome and needed!\nCaller: George Thomson. George is a traditional New England dance leader, calling fun, easy, and family-friendly circles dances, squares, and longways sets for barn and contra dances. He enjoys calling singing squares in the style of the late Ralph Sweet. He also plays the great highland bagpipes!.\nLive Music: The Dead Sea Squirrels. Don’t be fooled by the unlikely name: You’re gonna love dancing to Cathy Mason on fiddle; Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, and mandolin (but not all at the same time!); and Henry Yoshimura on guitar. They play widely for contra dances and are known for their danceable tunes arranged in medleys designed to closely match and enhance the movements of the particular contra dance being taught/called. They tend to push the boundaries of the southern style with fiddle and fiddle/guitar harmonies!\nAdmission: $13.00 per person OR students (with ID, please) pay $6. Donations are greatly appreciated and encouraged!\nFree Parking: There is plenty of free parking right in front of the hall.\nRole Terms: “Ladies & Gents” but all dancers are welcome to dance whichever role their heart desires."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "Join us on Saturday, December 9 at the Woodlawn Elementary School gymnasium in Lawrence, KS.\nBeginner’s lesson at 7:00pm. The dance starts at 7:30 and ends at 10:00. \nCaller: Jill Allen\nBand: The Atchisons \nOpen to both beginners and newcomers without experience, a free lesson will start at 7:00, so PLEASE BE PROMPT if you want to attend the lesson. All ages welcome, no partner needed. \nOur dances are social, inclusive, fun, and beginner friendly. No experience? No partner? No problem! All dances are taught and prompted, and feature live music. \nYou’ll hear our callers use the terms Larks and Robins. Larks dance on the left side of a pair of dancers; Robins dance on the right side. \nContra dancing is fun and vigorous! Wear comfortable clothes and clean shoes. No black heels and no dance powder allowed on the floor. \nFlexible admission rates for in-person dances: \n\nAdult admission: pay what you can between $8 to $15+ to help support our dances.\nAdults just listening (not dancing) $5\nStudents $5\nChildren under 16 free\n\nThe Atchisons \nMelissa and Bob Atchison have been playing for barn dances since the early 1980s. Their music has been influenced by old-time Missouri fiddlers, and music of the Ozarks. They love playing for dances because of the joy the dancers experience. As a duo of just guitar and fiddle they bring a surprising amount of energy and fun to Lawrence Barn dances. \nJill Allen \nSoon after receiving a B.E. in Dance Performance at the University of Kansas, Jill Allen came upon her first local country dance in the early 1980’s, unaware of how deeply it would change her life. It was love at first step and she never looked back. Her tap dancing became clogging and soon she learned to call for dances, with a hunger to teach every style she learned. With experience in dance education, Jill was a natural boss on the dance floor. Jill also organized dances for many years, and played piano for dances with the band “Fox on the Run” for 15 years. \nHer calling has been described as fun, easy to follow, and musical, with no time wasted getting a group of all ages and abilities up and dancing to the music. She is full-service caller with over thirty years of experience, well versed in Contras, Squares, English Country, Family Dances, Clogging, and couple dances."

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

The Banditos were formed in the late 1980s when original band member Dan Fassett and two of his students decided to practice their craft at a contra dance in the First Parish Church in Groton, MA. Those practice sessions evolved into the formation of the band. From a handful of fiddle members, we have grown into a band with typically eight members who play fiddle, banjo, guitar, piano, mandolin, whistle, bass and percussion.\nCaller: Don Heinold. Hailing from Rhode Island, Don has been calling at dances, weddings, and parties all over New England for over 14 years. Don is also known for teaching the Rotary (country) Waltz.\nAdmission: $5 suggested donation per person. Contributions are greatly appreciated!\nParking: on-street. Please be careful.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual. Please wear shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged, but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder).\nRole Terms are: “Women & Men,” but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role that works for them. with no worries."

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance.

Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

  - name: Sebastopol 1st and 3rd Sunday English Dance
    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "Ruff Ceilidhs – what are they? Well, we always have a live band with a caller who explains the dances. \nOther names for this kind of event include Twmpath, Barn-dance, Country dance and also sometimes e-Ceilidh. \nWhy RUFF? Well it has been described as short for ‘Roll Up For Folk’, but its really just a misspelling of Rough. Dave Parsons was once asked to create a display dance side very quickly, ‘What are you called?’ ‘Well it’s going to be rough…’ \nWhat we do is essentially traditional folk dancing. This does include new dances based on that tradition. You may have read of something like it in Jane Austen or Thomas Hardy.  Nowadays these dances are often seen at weddings, birthdays, PTA fundraisers or even at school. The reason some of these dances have survived for hundreds of years is that they are infectious and great fun. \nIt’s a wonderful way to meet people, mix the generations, get some exercise, laugh a lot and enjoy some really exciting live music."

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

Callers are Gene Murrow, Bruce Hamilton, and Kalia Kliban, accompanied by a quartet of beloved musicians: Daniel Beerbohm, Earl Gaddis, Mary Lea, and Jacqueline Schwab. Special events (wine tours, kayaking, hikes, etc.) and affordable accommodations (homestays, B&Bs, inns, etc.) are available to dancers coming from afar. \nDrawing from the many Boston Centre recordings that he produced for Bare Necessities, as well as from recordings by the bands Hold the Mustard and Reunion, Gene has assembled for this year’s Ball a legacy program of “classics” comprising significant and consequential English country dances. Kalia and Bruce will do varied programs on the Friday and Tuesday surrounding the Ball. The programs will be supported and enhanced by the artistry of our musicians, who have had considerable influence on the style of English country dance music in the United States and abroad. \nThe Mad Robin weekend offers English dancers a rare opportunity to dance with three of our genre’s most highly regarded teachers and callers accompanied by exceptional music, as well as enjoy the richness of the Bay Area’s culture and climate."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

After catching the contra bug, she began calling in 2014. Alex’s smooth voice, clear teaching style and engaging dance selections delight dancers from coast to coast. When she’s not calling, you can find her on the dance floor twirling away! Alex will be calling the advanced afternoon contras session. Video on YouTube. \nAnnie Kidwell\nAnnie Kidwell is an up-and-coming caller based in Boston, MA, having called at BIDA and Greenfield. We are thrilled to debut Annie’s spirited calling in NJ where they will be calling the all-level evening dance. \nGrand Picnic\nGrand Picnic first graced Swingin’ Tern’s stage in 1989 and has been serving up a musical feast of high-energy contras ever since.

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

Bob is also known for his unusual dance forms: the Zia is a literal cross between a square and a contra while Bob’s grid squares provide a wild ride. \nVideo on YouTube \nZach Kaplan\nZach Kaplan started contra dancing in 2018 in Boston. He’s known for being a friendly, courteous, and twirly dancer. He got the bug to call at the Swingin Tern’s 40th anniversary dance this year, and has quickly become a confident and clear caller. Zach welcomes all dancers to the hall and cares that every dancer feels happy, safe, comfortable, and welcome. \nBox and String Trio\nBox and String Trio is Bill Quern, Sarah Gowan, and Laura Alexander.\nWe play instrumental traditional roots music from the American Appalachians, England, Canada, Scandinavia, and France as well as our original music composed in traditional styles. With a combined instrument collection that includes guitar, cello, mandolin, concertina, melodeon, 4 & 5 string banjo, fiddle, harmonica, jaw harp and foot percussion we provide a varied and entertaining program. \nVideo on YouTube\nFull calendar \nUseful Information:\n\nNewcomers are welcome to come at 7pm for an introductory lesson on the basics of contra dancing. No partner is necessary. All dances are taught with a “walk-through” by the caller.\nWe no longer require vaccination. Masks are optional.\nAll dances at Swingin’ Tern are called to the gender-neutral terms Larks & Robins.\nWe have open windows on three sides and air-conditioning when needed.\nWe welcome contributions of home-baked [or not] goodies to share at the break.\nPlease bring your own water bottle. Water bottles may be filled at the kitchen sink.\nWear comfortable clothing. Contra dancing is aerobic. We prefer you carry in your shoes.\nWe are a friendly, inclusive group. Pack plenty of smiles!"

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

He’s also performed with the contra dance band Live Wire, the swing band Swingology, and as a ringer for concert and pit orchestras throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Most recently, he appeared as soloist alongside Grammy award-winning fiddler Jay Ungar and the Hudson Valley Philharmonic in a performance his own original arrangement of Daybreak in the Mountains. His work as a educator includes teaching engagements at the Ashokan Music and Dance camps since the age of 17. \nDani Hawkins has made music with the Boston Philharmonic, the Richardson Chamber Players, the Delaware Symphony Orchestra, and various other ensembles and contradance bands.

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18.

    details: "Although our usual Island Dance venue is sadly gone, we’re lucky enough to have found a replacement in the Algonquin Island Association Clubhouse, a beautiful breezy space right on the water…so our special summer dance event is on! \nPlease note the new EARLIER time, 11:30am to 6pm. There will be a late lunch break and a second, shorter break in late afternoon. \nFor this year’s Island Dance, we’re excited to welcome back the renowned caller Gaye Fifer from Pittsburgh, PA, with the outstanding quartet Contraforce all the way from Charleston, SC. This dance is always a blast, so don’t miss out! \nAs always, this will be a Larks & Robins dance. \nThis event will be mask-optional with a mask-mandatory line, and a well-ventilated large venue. We recommend that you bring a mask, even if you don’t wear it the whole time, so you have the option of dancing in both lines. We suggest you bring replacement masks with you, in case the original one (or the next one) gets too damp and therefore poorly performing / uncomfortable after a while. \nWe’re limited to 80 dancers, so get your tickets early. The sliding scale price for the dance is $25 – $50 CAD. As you are choosing your price, please remember that we always lose money on the Island Dance. We are hoping the ticket price will average around $38, to keep our anticipated losses to a minimum. \nCancellations: Covid-related cancellations get a full refund. Unrelated cancellations are offered until July 1, with a processing fee of $5. After July 1, no refunds will be issued. To cancel, send email to Marge at treasurer@tcdance.org. \nFor tickets, directions, and information about the ferry to the Toronto Islands, check out our website."

They are: Sarah Jane Nelson on guitar or fiddle (but not both at the sane time!) and Cathy Mason on fiddle. The High-Strung Strummers are a high energy duo that specializes in the old-time dance music of Appalachia, and the performance of Anglo-American ballads that found their home in that region. Cathy and Sarah have been finalists at the popular Lowell Banjo & Fiddle Contest, and they delight audiences with the rich harmonies and rhythmic accents of their “twin” fiddling!\nCaller: Don Heinold. Hailing from Rhode Island, Don has been calling at dances, weddings, and parties all over New England for over 14 years. Don is also known for teaching the Rotary (country) Waltz.\nAdmission: $15 suggested donation per person, or $10 for students per person.\nParking: plenty of parking behind the building. Walk around and enter from Massachusetts Ave.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual. Shoes that move easily on the floor work fine. Rubber-soled sneakers are okay, but make dancing much harder.\nRole terms are “Ladies & Gents” or “Women & Men,” but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role that works for them, with no worries."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

    details: "Julie Sorcek—flute, saxophone; Mickey Koth—fiddle; Robert Messore—guitar \n\nAll dances at Swingin’ Tern are called to Larks & Robins\nAdmission $15 [students $5]\nOur dance hall is air-conditioned.\nVaccination and masks optional.\n\nWith the best thing since sliced bread, Wry Bred rises to the occasion playing a Panettone on the Crumpet second to Naan. Challah Peter brings his bread Stix to give you what you knead with a basket full of no-loaf contras. Seagulls and Bagels join the Terns as they Zwieback and forth. We won’t Pumpernickel and dime you or take your Sourdough – it’s not a lot of bread. Don’t tortilla yourself by missing this – it would be a pita. Papadum’s got a brand-new Baguette! \nPeter Stix \nPeter Stix is a caller and dance organizer up in Albany NY. He has graced Swingin’ Tern’s stage since 1992. Stix started calling in 1989 in Minnesota (no doubt that’s where he developed his laid-back style). Clear teaching and varied dance selections are his trademarks, once you get past his PUNishing sense of humor. Undoubtedly he will have a great program for our dancing enjoyment.\nBesides dancing and calling, Stix teaches math; creates sculptures; builds “eccentric lazy susans;” writes satires and parodies for cathartic release; and is edging ever closer to an encore career as a stand-up comic. \nWry Bred \nThe contra dance trio Wry Bred has been energizing dance floors for years. With Julie Sorcek on flute and saxophone, Mickey Koth on fiddle, and Robert Messore on guitar, Wry Bred engages in rollicking musical conversations with driving rhythms and exuberant harmonies. Wry Bred: good music no matter how you slice it! \nFull schedule for Swingin’ Tern  \nUseful information:  \n\nNewcomers are welcome to come at 7pm for an introductory lesson on the basics of contra dancing. No partner is necessary.\nAll dances are taught with a “walk-through” by the caller.\nWe no longer require vaccination. Masks are optional.\nAll dances at Swingin’ Tern are called to the gender-neutral terms Larks & Robins. Dance whatever role you’re comfortable in.\nWe are air-conditioned. We have windows on three sides when we want to let the breeze come in.\nWe welcome contributions of home-baked [or not] goodies to share at the break.\nPlease bring your own water bottle. Water bottles may be filled at the kitchen sink.\nWear comfortable clothing. Contra dancing is aerobic. We prefer you carry in your shoes.\nThe dance is held two blocks from the Chatham station on the Morris & Essex line.\nWe are a friendly, inclusive group. Pack plenty of smiles"

Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18.

  - name: Sebastopol 1st and 3rd Sunday English Dance
    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

The afternoon workshop runs from 1:30-4:30 pm and the evening social dance from 6:30-9:30pm. \nPre-registration is required; please refer to the website for details."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \n​Recorded Music: $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21)"

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences.

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \n​Recorded Music: $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \n\n\n\n\n​“Pay What You Want” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th) – Newcomers especially encouraged to attend!"

    details: "2nd Sunday of the Month: \nLive Music with Anytime English Players \nEnglish country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \nLive Music: $15 General | $12 Member | $8 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21)"

Band members Kate Barnes, Earl Gaddis, Mary Lea, and Jacqueline Schwab, have been playing together since 1980.

Off the dance floor, Dan teaches music history at Denison University, and will happily talk about trivia, board games, and Broadway musicals at length. \nThe Weekend: Folknet, the Jane Austen Society Ohio North Coast Region, and the Cleveland dance community are pleased to be able to cooperate in helping to bring Bare Necessities to Northeast Ohio.

    details: "Join Brooklyn Contra to celebrate fall with back-to-back dances, featuring the calling of Julian Blechner and music from Kingfisher! We’ll be starting with Challenging Contras from 3:30-6:30, then returning after dinner break for a relaxing all-levels dance from 8-11pm (7:30 lesson). Meet us at Logan’s Run for afters, including food, drinks, great camaraderie, and casual blues dancing. \nJulian Blechner is a seasoned contra and set dance caller based in Western Massachusetts. Since 2011, he’s called dances of all sized, from big festival and camp stages, to dances of all sizes from Maine to the Mid-Atlantic. He has called for many years at the New England Folk Festival, was a headliner at Flurry Festival 2018, Old Songs Festival 2019, and performed at other dance festivals, special events, and weekends. He brings a cheerful, friendly attitude with clear, concise teaching and prompting. Julian has written dozens of dances, and combines this expertise with his love of dancing to provide a joyful flair to dances! \nKingfisher, the eclectic duo of Cecilia Vacanti and Jeff Kaufman, plays both traditional and modern contra dance music, and has been hailed as one of the most versatile up-and-coming dance bands on the road today. Already a mainstay in the Greater Boston area, they’ve performed to large, enthusiastic crowds on the West Coast, Eastern Seaboard, and throughout the Northeast. Jeff Kaufman, a multi-instrumentalist, anchors the duo from the piano, as well as mandolin and a number of innovative electronic instruments he created himself, providing the duo with bass and drum grooves — all of which gives Cecilia Vacanti opportunity to wow you with intense fiddling renditions of tunes across the spectrum, surprising even the most seasoned listener with a genre-bending playlist that is absolutely breathtaking. \n“The first time I heard Kingfisher I couldn’t see the stage at first. I was blown away when I got to the front of the room-expecting a 4 or 5 piece band, only to find out that sound-that BIG sound-was coming from just two, albeit two very talented musicians” -J.C, Fulton, NY. \nFrom the moment they hit the first note to the fade of the last chord, you’ll be mesmerized for the entire show! \nCost of entry:\nFree for Sustainer and Sponsor members, $9 for Supporter members and students, $15 for non-members, $25 for both dances"

We have occasional double dances along with a New Year’s Eve dance. \n$15 adults/$5 students \nCaller: Greg Frock\nGreg Frock’s discovery of contra dance was pure accident, but it was love at first dance. He began calling in 1992 after only 2 years of dancing, and quickly became a highly sought-after caller. Through his 30-year career, Greg has remained relevant by adapting to the changing culture of the contra community, and constantly seeking new, interesting, and accessible dances. Over the changing times, two elements of Greg’s approach has remained constant: keeping dances enjoyable for groups of dancers of varied size and skill levels, while teaching figures efficiently and intuitively. His calling talents have been appreciated by dancers throughout North America. \nBand: Good Company\nGood Company is a trio that primarily plays for contra dances around New England.

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \n​Recorded Music: $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21)"

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \n​Recorded Music: $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21)"

    details: "Our contra dances are held every first and third Saturday evening year-round from 7:30pm–10:30pm, with a beginners’ workshop at 7pm. We have occasional double dances along with a New Year’s Eve dance. \n$15 adults/$5 students \nCaller: Qwill Duvall\nIn Qwill Duvall’s words: I am a contra dancer and caller from the Midwest. I began contra dancing in 2015 shortly after moving to Chicago. A couple years later I began regularly traveling for dancing and I started calling in 2019. I called regularly in the Chicago area during 2019 and the beginning of 2020, and I was just thinking about going on tour when the pandemic hit. Since my work is now remote and dances have started back up, I am now on the road and touring! I’ve been at it since the beginning of 2023. I’ve called from the Midwest to the both coasts including NEFFA this past spring \nBand: The Dead Sea Squirrels\nThe Dead Sea Squirrels play widely for contra dances and are known for their danceable tunes arranged in medleys designed to closely match and enhance the movements of the particular contra dance being taught/called. They tend to push the boundaries of the southern style with fiddle and fiddle/guitar harmonies. Since all the musicians are also dancers, they understand the importance of the interaction between dancers and musicians, and how to use rhythm and dynamics to augment the feel and excitement of a dance. The Dead Sea Squirrels features Cathy Mason on fiddle, Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, and mandolin, and Henry Yoshimura on guitar. \nUseful Information:\n\nNewcomers are welcome to come at 7pm for an introductory lesson on the basics of contra dancing. No partner is necessary. All dances are taught with a “walk-through” by the caller.\nWe no longer require vaccination. Masks are optional.\nAll dances at Swingin’ Tern are called to the gender-neutral terms Larks & Robins. Dance whatever role you’re comfortable in.\nWe are air-conditioned. We have windows on three sides when we want to let the breeze come in.\nOur dance is two blocks from the Chatham station on the Morris/Essex line out of Penn Station, NYC.\nWe welcome contributions of home-baked [or not] goodies to share at the break.\nPlease bring your own water bottle. Water bottles may be filled at the kitchen sink.\nWear comfortable clothing. Contra dancing is aerobic. We prefer you carry in your shoes.\nWe are a friendly, inclusive group. Pack plenty of smiles!"

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \n​Recorded Music: $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \n\n\n\n\n​“Pay What You Want” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th) – Newcomers especially encouraged to attend!"
