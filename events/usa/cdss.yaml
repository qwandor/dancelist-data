    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "Yes, we have a new name! The Mystic Pie Dance!\nTime: Dance 7:30-10:30 pm [short basics session @ 7:15 pm]\nThis is so wicked fun! It is the most fun you can have with your clothes on! We dance to live music—the fiddle tunes of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Appalachia, and America. We often switch partners after every dance, so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time!\nLive Music by The Dead Sea Squirrels. Don’t be fooled by the unlikely name—you’re gonna love dancing to Cathy Mason on fiddle; Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, and mandolin (but not all at the same time!); and Henry Yoshimura on guitar. They play widely for contra dances and are known for their danceable tunes arranged in medleys designed to closely match and enhance the movements of the particular contra dance being taught/called. They tend to push the boundaries of the southern style with fiddle and fiddle/guitar harmonies!\nCaller: Paul Wilde from RI. Paul was a schoolteacher for 16 years and said that his classroom experience helped him to develop his calling skills on the dance floor.\nAdmission: $10 adults, $7 students. Donations gratefully accepted!\nHomemade Pie Slices! This month we offer pumpkin pie and other kinds of fall pies! These delicious pie slices are offered at the break for $3/slice to help support the band and caller.\nRole Terms are: “Ladies & Gents” (or Women & Men) but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role their heart desires.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual, layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneaker are discouraged but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder).\nParking: Plenty of parking in the large parking area next to the building!"

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

We often switch partners after every dance so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time! So come enjoy the friendly camaraderie, dance to live music and see everyone’s smiling faces!\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual; layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged).\nFood: Some snacks offered at the break and contributions are welcome and needed!\nCaller: George Thomson. George is a traditional New England dance leader, calling fun, easy, and family-friendly circles dances, squares, and longways sets for barn and contra dances. He enjoys calling singing squares in the style of the late Ralph Sweet. He also plays the great highland bagpipes!.\nLive Music: The Dead Sea Squirrels. Don’t be fooled by the unlikely name: You’re gonna love dancing to Cathy Mason on fiddle; Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, and mandolin (but not all at the same time!); and Henry Yoshimura on guitar. They play widely for contra dances and are known for their danceable tunes arranged in medleys designed to closely match and enhance the movements of the particular contra dance being taught/called. They tend to push the boundaries of the southern style with fiddle and fiddle/guitar harmonies!\nAdmission: $13.00 per person OR students (with ID, please) pay $6. Donations are greatly appreciated and encouraged!\nFree Parking: There is plenty of free parking right in front of the hall.\nRole Terms: “Ladies & Gents” but all dancers are welcome to dance whichever role their heart desires."

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

The dance starts at 7:30 and ends at 10:00. \nCaller: Jill Allen\nBand: The Atchisons \nOpen to both beginners and newcomers without experience, a free lesson will start at 7:00, so PLEASE BE PROMPT if you want to attend the lesson. All ages welcome, no partner needed. \nOur dances are social, inclusive, fun, and beginner friendly. No experience? No partner? No problem! All dances are taught and prompted, and feature live music. \nYou’ll hear our callers use the terms Larks and Robins. Larks dance on the left side of a pair of dancers; Robins dance on the right side. \nContra dancing is fun and vigorous! Wear comfortable clothes and clean shoes. No black heels and no dance powder allowed on the floor. \nFlexible admission rates for in-person dances: \n\nAdult admission: pay what you can between $8 to $15+ to help support our dances.\nAdults just listening (not dancing) $5\nStudents $5\nChildren under 16 free\n\nThe Atchisons \nMelissa and Bob Atchison have been playing for barn dances since the early 1980s. Their music has been influenced by old-time Missouri fiddlers, and music of the Ozarks. They love playing for dances because of the joy the dancers experience. As a duo of just guitar and fiddle they bring a surprising amount of energy and fun to Lawrence Barn dances. \nJill Allen \nSoon after receiving a B.E. in Dance Performance at the University of Kansas, Jill Allen came upon her first local country dance in the early 1980’s, unaware of how deeply it would change her life. It was love at first step and she never looked back. Her tap dancing became clogging and soon she learned to call for dances, with a hunger to teach every style she learned. With experience in dance education, Jill was a natural boss on the dance floor. Jill also organized dances for many years, and played piano for dances with the band “Fox on the Run” for 15 years. \nHer calling has been described as fun, easy to follow, and musical, with no time wasted getting a group of all ages and abilities up and dancing to the music. She is full-service caller with over thirty years of experience, well versed in Contras, Squares, English Country, Family Dances, Clogging, and couple dances."

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

The Banditos were formed in the late 1980s when original band member Dan Fassett and two of his students decided to practice their craft at a contra dance in the First Parish Church in Groton, MA.

From a handful of fiddle members, we have grown into a band with typically eight members who play fiddle, banjo, guitar, piano, mandolin, whistle, bass and percussion.\nCaller: Don Heinold. Hailing from Rhode Island, Don has been calling at dances, weddings, and parties all over New England for over 14 years. Don is also known for teaching the Rotary (country) Waltz.\nAdmission: $5 suggested donation per person. Contributions are greatly appreciated!\nParking: on-street. Please be careful.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual. Please wear shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged, but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder).\nRole Terms are: “Women & Men,” but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role that works for them. with no worries."

As always, if you are not feeling well regardless of the reason, please stay home. If you suspect or know that someone in your household currently has Covid, please stay home.
