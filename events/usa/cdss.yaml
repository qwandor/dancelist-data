    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance.

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Last Monday of the Month 8-10:30pm \nIn a contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18.

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall)."

    details: "Every Saturday\nLARGE STUDIO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:30 – 8:00 pm  Lesson\n8:00 – 11:00 pm  Dance\n \nCost:\nLive Music: $15 General Admission | $12 Tapestry Member | $8 Young Adult (Ages 18-30) | $4 Youth (Ages 10-17) | Under 10 – Free \n“Pay What You Choose” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th)\nRecorded Music:  $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \nWhat is Contra Dance?\nIn a Contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night Contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton and modern compositions. \nHow does Contra Dance Work?\n“A contra dance can be thought of as a triangle of energy with the three vertices being the musicians, the dancers and the caller. Magical evenings occur when all three come together, feeding off of each others’ energy to raise and sustain an atmosphere of fun and joy. The caller’s role in this is paramount. Good music and dancers without a good caller may not be magical. Poor teaching, lack of rapport or inappropriately selected dances can lead to frustration. But a good caller can make even new dancers feel like they are good, and by working with the musicians to match music to dances, set the right tempo, and feed off the energy of everyone in the hall, the caller can help make magic.”\nby Beau Farmer, Tapestry Folkdance Center Contra Caller"

Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18.

This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or spritely, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us!"

College Ave., Columbia, MO 65201 \nFeaturing:\nBig Brandy and Wendy Graham! \nBig Brandy—Four cross-genre musicians from the Cosmic Otters and Birdhouse Hollow combine forces to form Big Brandy. They take the best of old-time Appalachian, Irish, and French tunes and weave them into exhilarating arrangements, perfectly tailored for contra dancing. Meg Dedolph (guitar, percussion), Wren Eisenhauer (banjo, vocals), Jonathan Whitall (fiddle, piano), Qi Yang (accordion, piano). \nWendy Graham (Brasstown, NC) is a self-described “dance maniac.” Her passion for traditional folk music, song, and dance caught fire in 1991 on a youth dance tour in Denmark. Today, she leads many kinds of dance, including English Country, American contras and squares, partner (swing, latin, waltz, blues, country), and line dances at community and private events around the country and abroad—from Alaska to Denmark and everywhere in between. When not leading and teaching dance, Wendy programs dance weeks/weekends and classes for teens and adults at the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina. She proudly served on the Lloyd Shaw Foundation and Country Dance and Song Society (CDSS) board and Lifetime Contribution Award committee. She is a current CDSS nominating committee member."

The group formed after early collaborations playing for their local English country dance in Baltimore, and more than twenty years later, they’re still at it, playing a diverse and unusual repertoire featuring vintage mandolin music, French musette music, Jonathan’s original compositions, classical arrangements, Paul’s transcriptions of music from around the world, and Elke’s finds from the archives. Instrumentation is primarily violin, mandolin, and piano, but extends to accordion, guitar, viola, recorders, whistles, and ocarinas. \nCaller: Jenna Simpson \nJenna Simpson is a choreographer known for her innovative dances. Based in Williamsburg, Virginia, she regularly calls for both the local community English and Scottish Country Dances as well as for the student ECD club at the College of William & Mary, which she co-founded. Her ECD repertoire spans both the historical and modern canons – she has called for reenactors and for the Annual General Meeting of the Jane Austen Society of North America, but particularly delights in trying out and sharing new dance compositions. \nClick here for full information and to register."

He loves to choreograph evenings with a variety of dances and tempos that at times surprise and always delight, all the while keeping intact his guiding principle as a caller: “It’s about the dancers!” \nThe Figments are Anna Patton on clarinet, Ben Schreiber on Fiddle, and Owen Morrison on guitar. Besides playing as The Figments, these three are familiar from other bands including Elixir, the Dam Beavers, and the Faux Paws. They incorporate an eclectic mix of styles into their inspired performances of music for dancing or listening. Whether grooving on an Old-time, Irish or French Canadian fiddle tune, trading daring improvisations on a swing number, or exploring the nuances of a graceful waltz or elegant English country dance tune, this trio of versatile musicians makes dynamic, spontaneous, and electrifying music."

    details: "Welcome to the 2026 Whitewater Whirl. Whether you’re a dedicated, would-not-miss-it Whirler or new to the weekend, we look forward to dancing with you! The weekend is held at the Fayette County Park 4-H camp near Fayetteville, WV. Online registration is now open. \nThe Bands\nLouisville-based Hot Coffee Breakdown is one of the most popular bands on the contra dance weekend circuit. Tom Cunningham’s fiery fiddle combines with the driving rhythms of Kate Sanders on keyboard and Luis de Leon on percussion and harmonica. Their dynamic range and musical crescendos will make you want the dance to go on forever! From the Ohio hills, we welcome The Hollertones with Paul Brown on banjo, Linda Scutt on fiddle, Jeanie Thieken Creamer on guitar and vocals and Nick Weiland on bass, with a blend of traditional, old time and Celtic music that’s made them popular at contra dances throughout the Midwest and East Coast. \nThe callers\nThe talented Darlene Underwood from Cincinnati returns for her second Whirl to spread happiness, connection and fun. It’s a Whirl debut for the talented and very funny Bob Isaacs, choreographer of so many creative dances, who’s driving all the way from Princeton, NJ (thanks, Bob). \nWe’re delighted that Gaye Fifer will again join us to teach the Beyond the Basics waltz workshop. Regular Whirlers know that Gaye called at every Whirl from 2005 to 2024. She’s taking a break, but we hope she’ll be back as a regular Whirl caller in future. \nIn 2024, we added a late-night techno-contra with DJ Polly Whittaker teaming with “Queen Darlene.” It’s back by popular demand, retitled as “DJ Contra,” and with “King Bob” on the team. \nOur sound engineer, maestro Hanno Meingast, will be making the music in the hall sound great. \nAccommodation and meal plan\nCabin accommodation (metal frame bunk beds) or camping onsite at the Fayette County Park 4-H camp near Fayetteville, WV is included in the weekend price. When you register, let us know if you’ll be staying in one of the cabins, designated as coed, women and men. \nYou can pitch your tent anywhere, but if you’re pulling a camper the camp staff will tell you where to park. \nThe camp will open on Thursday night, April 30, for early arrivals. Consider staying Sunday night, May 3, hiking or rafting in the New River Gorge. \nCafé One Ten in Oak Hill, WV, will provide catering—a five-meal plan with vegetarian options. Jennifer Horrocks and Heather Oelker will be running the kitchen and dining hall, with Jennifer preparing her signature desserts for Saturday dinner. \n$140 for weekend; a la carte for evening dances and workshops"
