Schedule subject to revision. \nCome enjoy our warm hospitality, delightful dancing and varied culinary, cultural and shopping opportunities. If you’ve never visited Fairfield, you’re in for a treat! You’ll enjoy our incredible culinary offerings (Thai, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Ethiopian, Gourmet Pizza, Turkish) and world-class coffee at Cafe Paradiso, all within 1-2 blocks walking distance from the dance! \nImportant: All dancers must be fully vaccinated to attend. Please do not ask for exceptions.  Most likely, for everyone’s safety, we will also require negative covid tests (home tests are fine) 2 days before coming and again on the first day. If everyone complies (please do!) then we may be able to make masks optional. We will have a final decision regarding masks and tests 2 weeks prior to the weekend and will notify all registered dancers.  \nIn order to ensure that we have full attendance (and can therefore afford to pay all the expenses), we are asking everyone to register in advance. So if you know you want to come, please register today. Thank you! \n$175. Includes full weekend and all snacks.\nNote:  This weekend is designed for experienced dancers and attendance is limited. We sell out every year, so PLEASE register soon! \nRegister by sending email to FairfolkDancers “at” gmail “dot” com and then send check payable to Jennifer Hamilton to arrive within 5 business days via snail-mail to:\nFFADC PO Box 1321, Fairfield, Iowa 52556 \nPlease include name, address, phone and email.  We sold out way in advance last time and expect to do so for 2023. Your cancelled check is your receipt—please do not be disappointed if you do not get an email acknowledgement. If you enquire by email, you are not registered until we receive your check! The time/date of your email will be the tie-breaker if we sell out on the day we receive your check. \nWe are delighted to welcome Joanna Reiner Wilkinson back to Fairfield. Many of you enjoyed dancing with her in the past and we are fortunate to welcome her again! \nCancellation / Refund Policy: If you need to cancel for any reason, we will allow you to transfer your personal registration to the next year (for one year only). Or you can send someone—a previously unregistered dancer whom you find—in your place to this current year’s weekend and let us know about the substitution. You handle all the details and work out the payment with your friend. This applies only to the specific weekend you paid for. Other than these two options, unfortunately there are no refunds or exchanges. We simply do not have the volunteer staff to handle these complications. (If you have sent your check late and the dance is full, we will not cash your check.) \nLocation: The Morning Star Studio, 51½ S. Court St. Fairfield, Iowa. Exit 214 coming East on Route 34, then 3 miles West to Main Street, then North to Broadway, East to Court, South on Court St. Or Exit 216 coming West on Route 34, then North on Route 1 (Main St.) to Business 34, then 1 more block north to Broadway, East to Court, South on Court St."

We dance to the fiddle tunes of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, and Appalachia and we often switch partners after every dance so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time!!\nCaller: Billy Fischer! Billy has been calling dances for over thirty years, starting out in New Haven, Connecticut with the contra dance series that has been a fixture of the folk music and dance scene since 1976. In addition to contra dances in and around the northeast, he has called at various dance camps regionally and nationally. This will be quite a treat!\nLive Music: Dead Sea Squirrels are Cathy Mason on fiddle and mandolin; Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, mandolin, and vocals; and Henry Yoshimura on guitar and vocals.\nAdmission: (your choice) $10 – $12 p.p., $6 – $8 students, families $25. Donations are gratefully appreciated!\nFood! Donations of snacks for the break are wanted and gleefully appreciated!\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged, but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder).\nParking: There is plenty of parking behind the church by driving up State Street or up Gertrude Street.\nRole terms are: “Ladies & Gents” but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role their heart desires."

They are a groovy, eclectic folk band known for their unusual instrumentation and innovative musical choices. With inspiration ranging from traditional fiddle tunes to pop and various international styles, they transport their audience with their exciting, unique sound! They are: A.Z. Madonna – accordion, vocals; Cecile Leroy – cello, jaw harp, vocals; Daniel Raine – cittern, guitar, ukulele, banjo, vocals; Yaron Shragai – whistles, recorders, hand percussion, vocals.\nCaller: Don Veino from Massachusetts. Don says he loves to create opportunities for dancers to have fun, no matter the group size.\nHomemade pie slices! This month we offer a medley of all kinds of fall pies! These delicious pie slices are offered at the break for $3/slice to help support the band and caller.\nRole terms: “Ladies & Gents” (or Women & Men) but dancers are welcome to choose whatever works best for each dancer.\nClothing & footwear: Clothing is casual; layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged, but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder)."
