This dance is named after Odina Jönsson, 1875–1964, from Allerum, and can be done to both three-beat and two-beat music; i.e., it works for waltz, hambo, mazurka, polska, schottis, snoa, and polka music, making it a “universal” dance. It has a fun bakmes (CCW turn) one-legged pivot step for both lead and follow. <p>Then, at 8:30 p.m., the Folk Voice Band brings their cheerful and lively music. In addition to the intrepid couple, Birgit and Phil Ages, Joe Michaels and Frank Brown will round out their international flavor. Besides a great array of Nordic tunes, they will get us up and dancing together with some favorite Danish mixers.</p><span><b>Skandia members, $10; nonmembers, $15; kids, free  The price of admission includes a free dance class.</b></span>"
