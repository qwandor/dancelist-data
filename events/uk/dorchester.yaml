    details: "Dance away those winter blues with fun music, good company and lots of dancing!\r\natterdemalion play folk tunes which were being used in Dorset in the 19th Century, now brought to the modern day with verve and energy. The Big Dorset Midwinter Ceilidh is a great way to meet up with friends again after the busy festive period.\r\nThis year there is an early evening ‘Kiddies’ Keilidh’ for young families to enjoy an hour of dances more suited to shorter legs. Then later, the bar will be open to quench the thirst of the grown-ups who stay or come for the evening. A treat for those who enjoy the simpler things in life, such as fine company, good music, and energetic dancing!"
