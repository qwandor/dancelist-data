    details: "Join us for our contra dance with Ian and Charley Roberts with calling from Louise Siddons.\n\nProbably better known to regular contra dancers as one half of long-serving contra dance band Vertical Expression, Ian and Charley Roberts will be heading down from the Far North (well, Sheffield) armed with several melodeons, a piano, one or two guitars and a pair of tap shoes to provide some irresistibly danceable tuneage to accompany the dances.\n\nLouise Siddons was born in the UK but moved to the United States as a child, where she grew up  surrounded by folk music and song. Now back in the UK permanently, she is known on both sides of  the Atlantic as a contra, English country dance, and ceilidh caller. Louise believes that we  should invest in the evolution and sustainability of folk traditions and their ongoing relevance  to contemporary culture. As a caller and dance teacher, she strives to create a fun and welcoming  atmosphere with her low-key and light-hearted stage presence. She received the 2016 Mary  Judson/Brad Foster Award for English Dance Teachers from the Country Dance and Song Society  (CDSS), and has been a committee member for the Friends of English Dance (UK) since 2018. In 2021,  she received a diversity grant from the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS) in support of  her gender-free teaching and calling. In 2022, CDSS published her booklet on gender-free,  positional calling, “Dancing the Whole Dance: Positional Calling for Contra.” This winter, she is  starting Winchester's first-ever queer ceilidh series, WinQeilidh."

Strong believers in letting the music tradition live and breathe through sensitive interpretation, Vicki and Jonny allow the melody to sing without any constraints.

They have become deeply involved in folk dance over the last ten years; contra, ceilidh and ’social dance’ both as the duo and as Purcell’s Polyphonic Party.  They often insert performance elements into their dance music.  You are very likely to find yourself dancing to a song – and we dare you not to sing the chorus as you go.\n\nRachel Shapiro Wallace is a dance caller who strives to communicate connection, wonder, and joy through dancing.\n\nHaving stumbled upon contra dancing in Boston, Rachel eventually realized her passion for calling after moving to Chicago. She has called dances throughout America, the UK, and Paris. Since moving to her current home in Edinburgh, Rachel has helped organize Scotland's only contra dance series.\n\nRachel's high-energy approach involves clear, concise walk-throughs, flexibility in teaching and programming, and working with the band to create that groove that dancers love."

Hailing from Honolulu and now living in California, she cut her folk teeth in the Boston area, attending Berklee College of Music and spending years exploring the thriving New England folk scene and beyond. She has performed at many folk music and dance festivals, camps, and events, including at Ashokan Center's Northern Week, Halsway Manor in England, and Pinewoods Dance and Music Camp. Audrey’s fiddle playing is rhythmically lively and spontaneous; she's guaranteed to get you up and dancing.\n\nAlan Brunier and Adam Rich-Griffin (both of Contrasaurus and The Night Before, Adam also of Chaotic Good) are well-known faces on the UK contra dance circuit and specialise in playing contra dance tunes that are well matched to dances. They started making music together over a decade ago after meeting at Warwick Folk Society and, some might say remarkably, remain good friends and musical-partners-in-crime. In their spare time they are, respectively, involved with organising contra dance events at Chippenham Folk Festival and Sidmouth Folk Festival.\n\nDaisy calls for contra, ceilidh and English dances, and particularly enjoys making historical dances lively and accessible for new and more experienced dancers.  She also uses her experience as a drama lecturer, theatre practitioner and storyteller to give dances momentum, narrative and energy. \n\n[https://daisyblack.uk/](https://daisyblack.uk/)"
