Now back in the UK permanently, she is known on both sides of  the Atlantic as a contra, English country dance, and ceilidh caller. Louise believes that we  should invest in the evolution and sustainability of folk traditions and their ongoing relevance  to contemporary culture. As a caller and dance teacher, she strives to create a fun and welcoming  atmosphere with her low-key and light-hearted stage presence. She received the 2016 Mary  Judson/Brad Foster Award for English Dance Teachers from the Country Dance and Song Society  (CDSS), and has been a committee member for the Friends of English Dance (UK) since 2018. In 2021,  she received a diversity grant from the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS) in support of  her gender-free teaching and calling. In 2022, CDSS published her booklet on gender-free,  positional calling, “Dancing the Whole Dance: Positional Calling for Contra.” This winter, she is  starting Winchester's first-ever queer ceilidh series, WinQeilidh."

Louise believes that we  should invest in the evolution and sustainability of folk traditions and their ongoing relevance  to contemporary culture. As a caller and dance teacher, she strives to create a fun and welcoming  atmosphere with her low-key and light-hearted stage presence. She received the 2016 Mary  Judson/Brad Foster Award for English Dance Teachers from the Country Dance and Song Society  (CDSS), and has been a committee member for the Friends of English Dance (UK) since 2018. In 2021,  she received a diversity grant from the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS) in support of  her gender-free teaching and calling. In 2022, CDSS published her booklet on gender-free,  positional calling, “Dancing the Whole Dance: Positional Calling for Contra.” This winter, she is  starting Winchester's first-ever queer ceilidh series, WinQeilidh."
