    details: "At St Paul’s upstairs studio – door on side then up stairs. Times are room booking times. Don't expect to get in if you turn up early. Recorded music. Less experienced callers. Experimentation. Things might go wrong! May involve American square dance moves. There's no fixed plan for dances, just a long list of potential ones. No expectation for people to swing or twirl more than they want to. Ask us to teach anything you don't know. Cost is room hire split between attendees (around £3 at a guess)."
