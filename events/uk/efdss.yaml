All calling will be gender-free – everyone is welcome and encouraged to dance with anyone they choose, in any role, regardless of their gender – as you are guided through each dance. No previous experience or a partner is required.\r\n\r\nThis inclusive Chilled Ceilidh, like the evening Queer Ceilidhs, will be led by Queer Folk – and slightly adapted to make the experience more inclusive and comfortable for everyone.\r\n\r\nDances are at an inclusive pace so you can enjoy participating at an energy level that suits you.\r\nTicket capacity is reduced from 250 to 100 (80 dancing plus 20 supporters who are not dancing).\r\nThere will be longer pauses between dances to allow for time to regroup and there will be a long break at the interval (40 minutes) to allow proper time for refreshments and rest.\r\nThere will be good visibility in our iconic Kennedy Hall, with curtains open to allow for daylight and house lights so that there is a calm atmosphere.  \r\nSound levels and music volume will be kept at 75-80% of the usual level, so the music will be amplified but quieter than some events. Our Front of House team can provide earplugs on request.\r\nA dedicated quiet area is available.\r\nOur friendly Front of House team will be at the event to answer questions and guide you to our facilities. If you would like to speak to one of our team about your access requirements in advance of your visit, please contact us on info@efdss.org or 020 7485 2206.\r\n\r\nAt the English Folk Dance and Song Society, we believe in the power of inclusivity and are committed to creating an open and accessible environment for audiences, participants, visitors and staff. Everyone is welcome at Cecil Sharp House.\r\n\r\nAge recommendation:\r\nThis event is suitable for all ages. Children aged 16 and under must be accompanied by an adult."
