    details: "Join us on 30 September for the first Balfolk music, dance and social evening of the new season. We are delighted to welcome you back to our monthly balfolk dance evenings, where you can come and learn new dance steps while enjoying the company of other dance fans.\r\n\r\nThis month's event will include a dance workshop for beginners and a three-hour dance evening. During the workshop we will learn how to dance balfolk. You will be able to learn the most popular Balfolk dances : Scottish, Waltz, Circle, Shapelloise, Bourree, Romantic Mazurka, etc.\r\n\r\nBalfolk is the common name for a European folk dance revived and reintroduced in France in the 1970s. The popularity of this relatively young dance is due to the ability of talented musicians to modernise folk music. After discovering the new sound of well-known melodies, people began to dance this dance for themselves rather than to perform on stage. This transformed a traditional dance style into a new, creative and flexible dance that retained the deep-rooted dance steps without losing its community orientation. Today, this style of dance attracts dancers across Europe.\r\n\r\nThe dance workshop will be led by Augustas & Inga\r\n\r\nThe workshop is a great opportunity to improve your dancing skills and learn new moves, and at the dance ball, you will be able to put your knowledge into practice and enjoy the upbeat balfolk music. It's a chance to relax, have fun and socialize with other people who share your love of dance.\r\n\r\nWe invite both experienced balfok dancers and newcomers to join this cozy and friendly community.

    details: "\"Infinitum ball\" is the continuous, no-ending process of dancing, learning, and being together. This event will happen for the first time in Lithuania, so we hope to see everyone enjoying an infinite journey together. During the festival, there will be various workshops and dance balls. You will see performers from Lithuania and other European countries on the stage.\r\n\r\nWe would love to see how this festival becomes a tradition and connects Bal folk dancers from all over Europe.\r\nBehind the name:\r\n\r\nAd infinitum :\r\n1. meaning - without end or limit\r\n2. meaning - In context, it usually means \"continue forever, without limit,\" this can be used to describe a non-terminating process, a non-terminating repeating process, or a set of instructions to be repeated \"forever,\" among other uses. It may also be used like the Latin phrase et cetera to denote written words or a concept that continues for a lengthy period beyond what is shown. Examples include:\r\n\r\nBallo/ball :\r\n1. meaning - The Ballo was an Italian dance form during the fifteenth century, most noted for its frequent tempo and meter changes. The name ballo has its origin in Latin ballo, ballare, meaning \"to dance,\" which in turn comes from the Greek \"βαλλίζω\" \"to dance, to jump about.\" In Greece, there is a Greek dance named Ballos.\r\n2. meaning - Ballroom dances are social dancing, popular since the beginning of the 20th century, to dances in conventional rhythms ( ballroom dances) such as the foxtrot and the quickstep.\r\nProgram and other info later this year.\r\n\r\nDance is energy – Dance is freedom!\r\n\r\nNotice for Event Participants:\r\nPhotography and Videography Consent: As an attendee, you may be included in photographs and video recordings captured during the event. These materials are intended for promotional and archival purposes.
