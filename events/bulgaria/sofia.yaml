In just a short year, we have had the privilege of hosting 35 events, including workshop evenings, jam sessions, film screenings, dance concerts, and heartwarming festive gatherings. 🎉🎶💃\r\n\r\nWhile we recognize that Balfolk is still a small and budding movement in Bulgaria, especially when compared to the grand traditions that have flourished throughout Europe, we carry a deep desire to build a bridge, connecting our rich national culture with Europe's Balfolk traditions. 🌍🤝\r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce our first international event on November 25th. It will feature the live performance of \"Kissene Folk,\" a group from Italy that plays Balfolk music. We will also have a Balfolk dance workshop led by \"Les Punkies Folkies,\" from Spain.

Your presence would make it all the more memorable. 🎊😊\r\n\r\nAbout Balfolk:\r\n\r\nBalfolk is a style that revives traditional European dances and music from various regions. It often features live music and includes dances like schottische, polka, mazurka, circassian circle, repasseado, rondo, Irish dances, Balkan dances, and more. These dances are presented in a contemporary interpretation, making them accessible to everyone, regardless of previous experience. Dances are performed in circles, chains, or pairs, often with partner rotation, fostering a sense of community and building friendships. 💃🕺🎻\r\n\r\nSchedule for November 25th:\r\n\r\n18:15: Event Opening\r\n18:30: Balfolk dances workshop by Sara Caballero Les Folkies Punkies (Spain)\r\n19:30: Concert by Nebo (Bulgaria)\r\n20:30: Concert by Kissene Folk (Italy)\r\n22:00: Free dances and Jam session\r\n\r\nEntrance fees:\r\n\r\n25 BGN (~13 EUR) regular price\r\n20 BGN (~10 EUR) early bird price, if you purchase before Nov 10th. 🎫🐦\r\n\r\nFor people under 16 the entrance is free.\r\n\r\nRegistration form: \r\nEN : https://forms.gle/q3fZDuJUofWsmLqT8 📋👉\r\nIT: SOON \r\nBG: SOON\r\nES : SOON \r\n\r\nPartners: Club Mate & Time Heroes ⏰🤝\r\n\r\nAfter-Event Tradition:\r\n\r\nAs usually a traditional Balfolk birthday in Europe continues the celebration with dancing in a downtown spot until the break of dawn.

    details: "ON 19th of April we plan to have Mazurka Clandestina around the city of Sofia\r\n\r\n✦ES-BAL✦TRAD✦ embraces the challenge of uniting Bulgarian folk music with the richness of balfolk culture, creating an exhilarating atmosphere of friendship, smiles, music, and dance. Balfolkaria, supported by the Cervantes Cultural Institute in Sofia, invites you to immerse yourself in an unforgettable experience, divided into two parts - dance workshops and a ball.\r\nPART 1: DANCE WORKSHOPS with Dimo Slavchev from Divlya\r\n🕚 11:00 Coffee and introduction\r\n🕦 11:30 Introduction to uneven Bulgarian rhythms\r\n🕛 12:00 Bulgarian folk dances - kopanitsa, shirto, ginka, paidushko horo, and many others.\r\n🍽 14:00 Lunch\r\n🕓 16:00 Afternoon coffee and warm-up\r\n🕟 16:15 Balfolk dances with Juanfe Carrasco - mazurka, scottish-foho, and others.\r\n🍽 18:00 Dinner\r\nPART 2: DANCE BALL with Bal do Mero and Div Plet\r\n🕗 20:00 Doors open\r\n🕣 20:30 Bal do Mero, Spain\r\n🕙 22:00 Div Plet, Bulgaria\r\n🕚 23:00 Jam Session\r\n*The program may undergo minor changes; we will keep you informed!!!\r\n\r\nDimo Slavchev has been the leader of the Divlya folk dance club since 2006; he is also the choreographer of the representative group of Bulgarian folk dances \"Divlya\" at the Science and Nature Cultural Center since 2010.\r\nJuanfe Carrasco, passionate about guitar, singing, and rhythms since adolescence, explored dance styles such as flamenco and contemporary dance. Until he discovered balfolk and the tremendous possibilities this dance family offers, both for delving into European musical traditions and hybridizing them with other dance styles. He has attended balfolk concerts, workshops, and festivals since 2010 and has been conducting national and international workshops for over ten years.\r\n\"Div Plet\" includes Lou Carrig on accordion, Isabel Sokol-Oxman on gadulka and violin, Damian Diaz Merlis on guitar, and Stiu Ivanov on percussion and kaval. The members come from different parts of the world, including Ireland, the USA, Argentina, and Bulgaria, but they all share a passion for traditional Bulgarian music.\r\n\"Bal do Mero\" is a trio of violin, clarinet, and accordion born from the restlessness and love of three musicians for folk music and dance. Sara Caballero, Rodrigo Nosequé, and Silvia von Nadie decide to shape this underwater folk fable for which they compose songs with various rhythms, always inspired by the weightlessness of the seabed. A diverse repertoire of waltzes, mazurkas, pasodobles, jotas, and muñeiras.\r\nGet ready to dance and enjoy! 🎻💃🕺\r\n\r\nStay tuned for registration form"
