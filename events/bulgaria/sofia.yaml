    details: "Balfolkariya warmly invites you to celebrate our first year of activity. We are the pioneering association in Bulgaria with a simple yet ambitious mission - to introduce the beautiful world of Balfolk music, dances, and culture to our corner of the world. In just a short year, we have had the privilege of hosting 35 events, including workshop evenings, jam sessions, film screenings, dance concerts, and heartwarming festive gatherings. 🎉🎶💃\r\n\r\nWhile we recognize that Balfolk is still a small and budding movement in Bulgaria, especially when compared to the grand traditions that have flourished throughout Europe, we carry a deep desire to build a bridge, connecting our rich national culture with Europe's Balfolk traditions. 🌍🤝\r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce our first international event on November 25th. It will feature the live performance of \"Kissene Folk,\" a group from Italy that plays Balfolk music. We will also have a Balfolk dance workshop led by \"Les Punkies Folkies,\" from Spain. And to top it off, we will enjoy the authentic Bulgarian music and dances of \"Nebo,\" a local ensemble. 🎵🕺\r\n\r\nWe look forward to celebrating this special milestone with you, our friends and fellows. Your presence would make it all the more memorable. 🎊😊\r\n\r\nAbout Balfolk:\r\n\r\nBalfolk is a style that revives traditional European dances and music from various regions. It often features live music and includes dances like schottische, polka, mazurka, circassian circle, repasseado, rondo, Irish dances, Balkan dances, and more. These dances are presented in a contemporary interpretation, making them accessible to everyone, regardless of previous experience. Dances are performed in circles, chains, or pairs, often with partner rotation, fostering a sense of community and building friendships. 💃🕺🎻\r\n\r\nSchedule for November 25th:\r\n\r\n18:15: Event Opening\r\n18:30: Balfolk dances workshop by Sara Caballero Les Folkies Punkies (Spain)\r\n19:30: Concert by Nebo (Bulgaria)\r\n20:30: Concert by Kissene Folk (Italy)\r\n22:00: Free dances and Jam session\r\n\r\nEntrance fees:\r\n\r\n25 BGN (~13 EUR) regular price\r\n20 BGN (~10 EUR) early bird price, if you purchase before Nov 10th. 🎫🐦\r\n\r\nFor people under 16 the entrance is free.\r\n\r\nRegistration form: \r\nEN : https://forms.gle/q3fZDuJUofWsmLqT8 📋👉\r\nIT: SOON \r\nBG: SOON\r\nES : SOON \r\n\r\nPartners: Club Mate & Time Heroes ⏰🤝\r\n\r\nAfter-Event Tradition:\r\n\r\nAs usually a traditional Balfolk birthday in Europe continues the celebration with dancing in a downtown spot until the break of dawn.
