    details: "Queer Folk are back with another one of their famed queer ceilidh dance parties!\r\n\r\nEnjoy a night of ceilidh dancing and drag on our historic dancefloor with live music from the queerest ceilidh band around.\r\n\r\nNo dance experience necessary, just open arms! Everyone is welcome alone, with a partner, or with a group - regardless of gender identity or sexuality.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to making everyone feel welcome at our events, and so all calling will be gender-free at this dance.\r\n\r\nDrag performer: Rosa Garland\r\n\r\nRosa Garland (otherwise known as their alter egos Trash Salad and PB) is a clown, singer, writer and burlesque artist on the queer cabaret scene. They like things that are sticky, sexy and stupid. They are fresh off a critically acclaimed Edinburgh Fringe run of their newest solo show, 'Primal Bog', which was featured in The New York Times’ 7 Buzziest Shows of the Fringe as well as winning one of The Skinny’s Besties Awards and being nominated for NextUp’s Biggest Award in Comedy and the Comedians’ Choice Award for Best Show. Rosa Garland is, in the words of Metro (and herself), a “supernova talent”."
