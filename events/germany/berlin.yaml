    details: "Balfolk A1: Balfolk basics\r\n\r\nIn this course we'll be teaching a variety of Balfolk dances from scratch – no dance experience required! During the course, you'll learn couple dances such as Scottish, Waltz, Mazurka, Polka, and two-time Bourrée, as well as group dances such as Chapelloise and Hanter dro. You'll also learn about posture, leading and following, and listening to the music.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBalfolk A2/F: Various group dances\r\n\r\nLanguage: German / English (depending on preferences of participants)\r\n\r\nIn this partially advanced course, we want to dive into balfolk group dances from different (mostly French) regions like Bretagne, Poitou, Auvergne and a few others. We want to show you the huge variety of those dances, the very different characters and styles, and how much fun these dances can be. We also want to explore the particular traditional spirits which some of those dances have, creating an atmosphere of community and deep connection within the whole group and to the music.\r\n\r\nDances we want to cover include different Avant-deux's, Congo, Maraîchine, Bourrée variants with multiple people, Suite de Loudéac and many more group dances. We won't cover couple dances in this course."
